## What is OWASP Middleware?

OWASP Middleware provides ready-to-use protections in modern application frameworks. It often includes libraries and middleware components that integrate into web applications to enforce security measures automatically or with minimal configuration.

## Key Features

1. **XSS Protection**:  
   - Automatically sanitizes user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
2. **CSRF Protection**:  
   - Generates secure tokens to prevent unauthorized requests.
3. **Input Validation**:  
   - Validates and sanitizes input to prevent injection attacks.
4. **Secure Headers**:  
   - Enforces HTTP security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and HSTS.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**:  
   - Implements secure mechanisms to handle user identity and access control.
6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:  
   - Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests per user or IP.
7. **Logging and Monitoring**:  
   - Tracks suspicious activities and aids in detecting and responding to threats.

## How OWASP Middleware Works

1. **Middleware Components**:  
   - Installed in the request pipeline of web applications to inspect, modify, or reject incoming and outgoing requests.
2. **Security Policies**:  
   - Enforces security configurations like input validation, token generation, and header settings.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:  
   - Logs suspicious activities for review and remediation.
